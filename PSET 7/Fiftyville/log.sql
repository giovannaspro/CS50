--Description:
--"Theft of the CS50 duck took place at 10:15am at the Chamberlin Street courthouse.
--Interviews were conducted today with three witnesses who were present at the time
--â€” each of their interview transcripts mentions the courthouse."

--With the description, search for the transcription of the 3 witnesses using the interviews table

--Working with the first transcript:
--"Sometime within ten minutes of the theft, I saw the thief get into a car in the courthouse
--parking lot and drive away. If you have security footage from the courthouse parking lot,
--you might want to look for cars that left the parking lot in that time frame."

--The thief then asked the person on the other end of the phone to purchase the flight ticket."
